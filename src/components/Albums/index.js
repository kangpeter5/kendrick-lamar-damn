						<h3>Damn</h3>
						<p>Damn received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 96, based on 37 reviews. Writing for The A.V. Club, Evan Rytlewski concluded, "Lamar trusts every idea to stand on its own. When you're making art this substantial, vital, and virtuosic, there's no need to wrap a tidy bow around it." In his review, Greg Kot of Chicago Tribute states, "Damn. strips down the rhythms to their essence, flavored with the occasional cameo. Lamar's voice does most of the heavy lifting, playing multiple roles and characters. His supple singing complements a variety of rap tones and textures."</p>
